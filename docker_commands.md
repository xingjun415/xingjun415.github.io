# Commands about Container

```
docker build -t friendlyname .  # Create image using this directory's Dockerfile
docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyname  # Run "friendlyname" mapping port 4000 to 80
docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyname         # Same thing, but in detached mode
docker ps                                 # See a list of all running containers
docker stop <hash>                     # Gracefully stop the specified container
docker ps -a           # See a list of all containers, even the ones not running
docker kill <hash>                   # Force shutdown of the specified container
docker rm <hash>              # Remove the specified container from this machine
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)           # Remove all containers from this machine
docker images -a                               # Show all images on this machine
docker rmi <imagename>            # Remove the specified image from this machine
docker rmi $(docker images -q)             # Remove all images from this machine
docker login             # Log in this CLI session using your Docker credentials
docker tag <image> username/repository:tag  # Tag <image> for upload to registry
docker push username/repository:tag            # Upload tagged image to registry
docker run username/repository:tag                   # Run image from a registry
```

# Commands about Services
## Understanding services
In a distributed application, different pieces of the app are called “services.” For example, if you imagine a video sharing site, it probably includes a service for storing application data in a database, a service for video transcoding in the background after a user uploads something, a service for the front-end, and so on.

Services are really just “containers in production.” A service only runs one image, but it codifies the way that image runs—what ports it should use, how many replicas of the container should run so the service has the capacity it needs, and so on. Scaling a service changes the number of container instances running that piece of software, assigning more computing resources to the service in the process.

Luckily it’s very easy to define, run, and scale services with the Docker platform – just write a **docker-compose.yml** file.

```
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
    image: username/repository:tag
    deploy:
      replicas: 5
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.1"
          memory: 50M
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    networks:
      - webnet
networks:
  webnet:

```
## Commands 

```
docker stack ls              # List all running applications on this Docker host
docker stack deploy -c <composefile> <appname>  # Run the specified Compose file
docker stack services <appname>       # List the services associated with an app
docker stack ps <appname>   # List the running containers associated with an app
docker stack rm <appname>                             # Tear down an application
```
